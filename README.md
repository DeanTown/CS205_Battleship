##Battleship
##CS205 Final Project


#Project:
    The goal of our project is to implement the board game Battleship with two game modes: Human vs Computer and Human vs Human. We will be creating a GUI displaying the different piece designs on a labeled grid, with the ability to drag and rotate pieces while setting up the board.
In the Human vs Computer game mode, we will create an AI for the opponent which decides strategic piece set ups and tracks down ships by keeping track of previous hits/misses.

#Reach:
	If we successfully implement Human vs Computer, the reach goal for our project is to also create a Human vs Human mode where it will swap between two screens for each player in the game.
