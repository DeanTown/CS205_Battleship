# Battleship

# CS205 Final Project

## Sprint 1 instructions:
    
    In sprint 1 we created the model of the game.
    To run the game, run graphics.cpp and follow the onscreen instructions.
    Also, the graphics branch on github is where Hannah and Teemo made most of their commits this sprint. Oliver and Harry
    wrote most of the game functionality which is on master.

    TO PLAY THE GAME:
    - To run the game, run graphics.cpp and follow the onscreen instructions.
    - The board is displayed as a 10x10 map of letters indicating what is placed on
    that space
    When the computer board is displayed to you you will only see "nothings" and when you get a missed hit
    it will be a + and when you hit an opponents ship there will be a X
    KEY:
    o - nothing
    + - nothingHit
    X - unknown piece hit
    b - battleship
    B - battleshipHit
    cr - cruiser
    CR - cruiserHit
    c - carrier
    C - carrierHit
    d - destroyer
    D- destroyerHit
    s- submarine
    S- submarineHit

    When all opponents pieces have been sunk or all your pieces have been sunk, the game will end!

## Project:

        The goal of our project is to implement the board game Battleship with two game modes: Human vs Computer and Human
    vs Human. We will be creating a GUI displaying the different piece designs on a labeled grid, with the ability to
    drag and rotate pieces while setting up the board.

        In the Human vs Computer game mode, we will create an AI for the opponent which decides strategic piece set ups
    and tracks down ships by keeping track of previous hits/misses.

## Reach:

	    If we successfully implement Human vs Computer, the reach goal for our project is to also create a Human vs Human
	mode where it will swap between two screens for each player in the game.
