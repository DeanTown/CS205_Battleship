# Welcome to Battleship!

# CS205 Final Project

## Instructions:
        To run the game, run graphics.cpp.

        After hitting the play button, you will be faced with two mode options: Human vs Computer or Human vs Human. After deciding
     which mode you want to play in, it is time to place your ships

     Human vs Computer:
        You will be prompted with a board, place your ships as you want.
        To SELECT a ship, tap on the ship and then move your mouse to where you want the ship to be on the board and tap again.
        To ROTATE a ship, select the ship you want and click 'r' on your keyboard.
        Once all your ships are where they want to be click 'DONE'.

        Hit the 'ATTACK' button when you are ready to fire on your opponents. After you have fired by clicking on a square, click
        on the 'DONE' button and now the computer will fire. Continue back and forth until the a player has sunk their opponent's
        entire fleet.

     Human vs Human:
        Have the computer be in the hands of the first player. They will place their ships first. When the first player has completed
        placing their ships, click "DONE" and hand the screen over to player 2. Player 2 will then place their pieces.

        Player 1 will fire first. After player 1 is done firing, "HIT ENTER" will be displayed on the screen. This is the time when
        player 1 should pass the screen over to player 2 for their turn to fire. Hit enter on your keyboard when the next player is
        all set to fire.
        Continue back and forth until the first player takes out the others entire fleet.


## Project:

        Our project is an implementation of the board game Battleship. We have implemented two game modes: Human vs Computer
     and Human vs Human. The Human vs Computer game mode uses AI to strategically place ships, track down ships, and keep track
     of previous hits and misses. The AI thinks like a human would when playing. When it hits a ship, it goes off of where it
     hit to take down the ship rather than just hitting random cells on the board.
	    While we were not able to accomplish all of our reach goals in our GUI, our GUI is clean and user friendly. It has the
	 ability to drag and rotate pieces while setting up the board, as well as uses textures to replicate wave motions


## Reach:

	    We were able to accomplish our reach goal of creating a Human vs Human mode that allows to players to swap the
	  screen and play against each other. We unfortunately were not able to accomplish our reach goals for the GUI. We wanted
	  to create hit animations and ship drawings, but were not able to accomplish that in time.
